# OOP-Gjango-SportBot
___________________________________
This project is aimed to help people with tracking their sport activity and track the activities of the others. The behaviour template of the site is made of aggregation e-blogs and social networks. The project is similar to "Mi Fit" app by Xiaomi, but the main preference is that web-site(when will be hosted) is available to all internet users and doesn't need installation and internal device memory. So I can say that it supposed to be an widely-available analog of the already mentioned app.
